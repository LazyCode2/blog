## Hello, world!

Greetings from my blog! This post is the first of many where I will share my thoughts, experiments, and discoveries.  
I write to record and develop, no matter it's code, ideas, or minor discoveries.

A special thank you to the person who helped me escape my fears. I was constantly terrified of being judged and humiliated, and their encouragement gave me the courage to start writing again. 🌻

Here’s to learning, experimenting, and writing without fear. Thank you for helping me begin this journey again. 🚀

```
	Stay tuned!
